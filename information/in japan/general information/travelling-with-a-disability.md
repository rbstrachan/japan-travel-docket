Many major tourist destinations are accessible and general information on their accessibility can be found on their website. Roughly 35% of Japan's train stations are entirely accessible. Pavements and sidewalks in Japan are typically smooth and all roadsides and crossings in major traffic areas are fitted with bright yellow raised pathways to indicate safe walking paths.
