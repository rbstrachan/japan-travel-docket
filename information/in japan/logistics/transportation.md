Pre-paid IC cards are an essential component of travel in Japan. They are used to quickly and easily transfer between train lines, pay bus and boat fares easily and save money on journies that consist of multiple transport methods. They can also be used at some vending machines, convenience stores and with some taxi companies.

A 500 yen returnable deposit is required at purchase.
